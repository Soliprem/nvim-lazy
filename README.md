# Soli's lazy nvim config
![image](img/screenshot1.png)
This work is based on the config made for the [LazyVim](https://github.com/folke/LazyVim) project by the amazing [Folke](https://github.com/folke)  
To install, simply clone the repo in the config location:
```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim-backup
git clone https://github.com/soliprem/nvim-lazy ~/.config/nvim
```
Enjoy!
